## The Project

Tetrium was created as a continuation to a game that i and a friend worked on in about 2010. When we realized that VBA or Excel 2000 didn't have the ability to connect to a database service, the original project was abandoned.

I worked on this project mainly between 2010 and 2014. Development started to slow down as the codebase grew larger. I abadoned development of Tetrium at the end of 2015 and decided to add it to version control for backup. After 2015 i have made mostly small features and bugfixes. 

Over the years as i have gained knowledge in programming, i realize that most of the code is complete trash. I published the code here as a reminder of all the thousands of lessions learned over the years.
