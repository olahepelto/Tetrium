## The Project

Tetrium was created as a continuation to a game that i and a friend worked on in about 2010. When we realized that VBA or Exel 2000 didn't have the ability to connect to a database service the project was abadoned.

I worked on this project mainly between 2010 and 2014. Development started to slow down as the codebase became larger. I abadoned development of Tetrium in the end of 2015 and decided to add it to version control for backup. After 2015 i have made mostly small features and bugfixes.
